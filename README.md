## What for is it
To be fair, there are only two reasons:

- CD Project RED released a Heartstone clone as a separate game and named it Gwent instead of simply porting this mini-game masterpiece to other platforms.
- I need some practice in Kotlin. Also, this repository would be a good string in a job application, for example.

## License
MIT license, as you can see in LICENSE file.
Project is fully nonprofit, I'm not going to make money from someone other's idea. Also, I'm scared of Poland copyrighters (help me) =)

## Conclusion
Feel free to leave bugs in issues section.
